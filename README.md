This is my very personal Django project where I want to put all of my ideas to make my life easier.

### Why is it public ?

I'm always open to remarks and suggestions in order to progress in Python and Django !

## Installing benbb96

To install and use my website, follow these steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/Benbb96/benbb96-website.git
cd benbb96
```

Create a file here which will store all secrets settings : `secrets.json`.  
You can configure it like this :

```
{
  "SECRET_KEY": "[YOUR SECRET_KEY]",
  "GOOGLE_API_KEY": "[YOUR GOOGLE_API_KEY]",
  "GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_KEY": "[YOUR GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_KEY]",
  "FIREBASE_CONFIG": {
    [YOUR FIREBASE CONFIG]
  },
  "EMAIL_HOST_USER": "[YOUR EMAIL_HOST_USER]",
  "EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD": "[YOUR EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD]"
}
```

Then, you should create a virtual environement, load the migration to build the database (`db.sqlite3`), create a superuser to be able to access the administration module, and finally run the server :

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
python manage.py runserver
```

You can then create projects in [127.0.0.1:8000/admin/base/projet/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/base/projet/) that will be displayed on the homepage.
